Create "not" font-face "icons" for social websites

## About

Nowadays, resisting peer pressure and trying to join as little as possible any kind of social network is very hard.

You need to be proud of resisting, and display your anarchism on your blog/webpage/whatever.

Yet you're curious about how the web is made and want to be (kinda) part of it.

That's why you want anti-@font-faces like those:

## Using

    make svg
    make show

And hack html/css/everything from the `demo.html` page source that opened

##Â Add more fonts

Copy SVG files of the icon you want to cross out in `src_icons` folder.

The SVG has to be as simple as possible, with just a path defined.
